Software Configuration Management Tools
==========================================

GitHub
-------

This is a website where our code is stored using a Git Configuration Management Tool. Additionally, we create project(s) and use the Kanban board to manage activities. Visit Our main github page.

GitKraken
----------

This is a desktop interface to Git -- specifically GitHub -- where our code and projects reside. This makes it easier to interact with the remote repository using a GUI instead of the command line. We use the free version that can be downloaded from here.



VS Code Plugin
