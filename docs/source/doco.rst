Documentation Tools
=========================


Doxygen
-----------------
This allows us to generate documentation from our code. Using markers in the code will control what gets written. Download the excutable from <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html" target="_new">here</a>. Run the wizard to generate the documenation files.

DrawIO / Diagrams.net
----------------------------------

Go to <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_new">diagrams.net</a> to utilize the tool online; it can also be downloaded from <a href="https://get.diagrams.net/" target="_new">https://get.diagrams.net/</a>.   Use the UML tab to get the objects necessary for State, Class, Sequence and Use Case Diagrams.

StarUML
----------------------------------

This was previously used for UML diagrams and there may be some floating around.   This became hard to get the right version as the open source version was unsupported and there were version changes started being incompatible.   If you need the tool, this was the last known place to download it that was compatible with the version we were using <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/staruml/files/latest/download" target="_new"> here </a>.  We use version 5.0.2.1570 (there are other versions that are not compatible or really buggy as well as other similar sounding tools).  One nice feature of this tool was we could generate diagrams from the source code.
