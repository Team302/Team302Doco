============================
Path Generation = Choreo
============================


This is used to generate paths ahead of time.  Documentation is found at:  https://choreo.autos/

Previously, we have used PathPlanner and PathWeaver, but we like Choreo better.  PathPlanner is still ok for generating paths on the fly, but we have switched to a servoing schema which is faster and seems to work better. 

We have not generated WPI trajectories directly.   

We have not explored Helix Navigator.
